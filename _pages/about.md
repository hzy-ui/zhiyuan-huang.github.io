This is my home website. I am still constructing this website. Hope you will know me better! 

Education
======
I got my B.E. degree in Automation at [Qingdao University](https://english.qdu.edu.cn/) in Qingdao, China in June 2021. 
I received my M.E. degree in Control Science and Engineering at [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm) in Xiamen, China, under the supervison of Prof. [Xiao Yu](https://xiaoyu.xmu.edu.cn/) in June 2024.
<!-- I am currently a Ph.D. student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) in Guangzhou, China. -->

<!-- ~~In September 2024~~ In January 2025\*, I am expected to begin my Ph.D. studies in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) under the supervision of Prof. [Jun Liu](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/people-profiles/jun-liu). 


\* I received my Letter of Acceptance from the University of Waterloo in February 2024, with plans to begin my Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics in September 2024. Unfortunately, the IRCC’s background verification process has taken an unreasonable extended time, starting from May 20, and my study permit has still not been approved. Given these delays, I’ve had to defer my admission to Winter 2025 and am still awaiting approval for my study permit. :(
