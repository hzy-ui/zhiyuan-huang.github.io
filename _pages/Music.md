I have a deep love for music—both listening to it and playing it. I began learning electronic piano at the age of four, which laid the foundation for my musical journey. At seventeen, when I started my undergraduate studies, I picked up the acoustic guitar. Later, during my master’s program at twenty-one, I began playing the electric guitar. Most recently, after completing my master’s degree at twenty-five, I started learning the drums.

This is my [personal Bilibili profile](https://space.bilibili.com/323265389?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0), where I share videos of my own performances and live shows I’ve attended.

## Music genres
I love listening to different genres of music, including Blues, Jazz, R&B, Soul, Pop music, country music, etc. 

## Music band
Between 2022 and 2024, I founded a music band at Xiamen University named ‘南国 (Now Go),’ where I played and performed with fellow music enthusiasts.
