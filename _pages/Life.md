About my life (我的生活).

I was born in 1999 in Qingdao, a beautiful coastal city in Shandong Province, China.

## Sports
I started learning table tennis when I began primary school at the age of five. It was the first sport I ever played, and it remains the one I've practiced the longest. In middle school, I learned how to swim and joined the school soccer team. I also developed a passion for skating around that time. In addition, I can play tennis, badminton, bowling, and golf.
